## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your local machine.
- Git installed (optional, for cloning the repository).

## Getting Started

### Setting up the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (if you haven't already):

   ```git clone https://github.com/nischalbista0/bookshelf-assessment```

2. Navigate to the project directory using your preferred terminal (e.g., Git Bash or CMD):

3. Install project dependencies using npm:
   
    ```npm install```

4. Now that you've set up the project, you can run the React application locally:
   
    ```npm start```

This command will start the development server, and your application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
